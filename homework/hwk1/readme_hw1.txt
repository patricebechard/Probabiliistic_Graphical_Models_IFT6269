The program is written in python 3.5.1 and uses the numpy and matplotlib modules.

to run it, simply call the following command : python3 hw1.py

the program outputs the numerically computed frequentist bias and frequentist variance as well as the bias and the variance from the formulas derived in question 3(d).

The program finally outputs the histogram asked.

a typical output for the program is the following:

frequentist bias : -0.199714 , frequentist variance : 0.318411
theoretical bias : -0.000020 , theoretical variance : 0.000040
