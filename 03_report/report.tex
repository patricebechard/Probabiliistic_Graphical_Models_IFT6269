\subsection{Latent Dirichlet Allocation}

\subsubsection{Generative Process}
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilisitic model of a corpus of $D$ documents $\{\mathbf{w}_1,..., \mathbf{w}_D\}$. Each document is a sequence of $N_d$ words from a vocabulary indexed by $\{1,...,V\}$, i.e $\mathbf{w}_d = (w_{d,1},...,w_{d,N_d})$.

The basic idea behind LDA is that each document is represented as a random mixture over $K$ latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a multinomial distribution over words, parametrized by a vector $\bm{\beta}_{k}$, $k \in {1,...,K}$. 

Formally, LDA assumes the following generative process for each document $\mathbf{w}_d$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample a distribution over topics $\bm{\theta_d} \sim Dir(\bm{\alpha})$
\item For each of the $N_d$ words $w_{d,n}$ independently:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a topic from the distribution over topics $z_{d,n} \sim Mult(\bm{\theta}_d)$
\item Draw a word from this topic \\ 
$w_{d,n} \sim Mult(\bm{\beta}_{z_{d,n}})$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
This generative process is illustrated in the directed graphical model of figure \ref{graph_model}.

\end{figure} 

The joint distribution associated with this model is:
\begin{multline} 
	\label{joint}
	(\prod_{k=1}^{K} p(\bm{\beta}_k | \bm{\eta})) \\
	(\prod_{d=1}^{D} p(\bm{\theta}_d | \bm{\alpha})
	(\prod_{n=1}^{N_d} p(z_{d,n} | \bm{\theta}_d) p(w_{d,n} | z_{d,n}, \bm{\beta}_{1:K})))
\end{multline}
where \\
$p(z_{d,n} | \bm{\theta}_d) = \bm{\theta}_{d, z_{d,n}}$ \\
$p(w_{d,n} | z_{d,n}, \bm{\beta}_{1:K}) = \bm{\beta}_{z_{d,n},w_{d,n}}$ \\
$\bm{\beta}_k \sim Dir(\bm{\eta})$ \\
$\bm{\theta}_d \sim Dir(\bm{\alpha})$ \\

This generative process is just a model of the structure we assume to be in our data. In reality, we only observe documents $\mathbf{w}_{1:D}$ and our goal is to infer the underlying topic structure: the topics $\bm{\beta}_{1:K}$, and for each document the distribution over topics $\bm{\theta}_{d}$, and the topic assignment $z_{d, n}$ for each word of the document.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Fitting the Model}
Since the generative process assumes independence between documents, the log likelihood of the whole corpus decomposes as a sum of terms for individual documents. In order to clarify the notation, from now on let us consider consider equations for a single document $\mathbf{w}$ with $N$ words.

Assuming $\bm{\alpha}$ and $\bm{\beta}_{1:K}$ are fixed, the log likelihood of a single document $\mathbf{w}$ takes the form:
\begin{equation}
log p(\mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}) =
	log \int \sum_{\mathbf{z}} p (\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}) d\bm{\theta} 
\end{equation}

Because of the integral over $\bm{\theta}$ and the sum over $\mathbf{z}$ inside the log, we cannot maximize this objective directly. One common way to solve this problem is the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We make the following observation:
\begin{align}
log p(\mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}) 
&= log \int \sum_{\mathbf{z}} \frac{p (\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}) q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})}{q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})}  d\bm{\theta} \\
&= \mathbf{E}_q [log \int \sum_{\mathbf{z}} \frac{p (\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})}{q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})}  d\bm{\theta}] \\
&\geq \mathbf{E}_q [log p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})] + \mathbf{E}_q [log q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})] \\
&= \mathcal{L}(q, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})
\end{align}
where we have introduced an arbitrary distribution $q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})$ over the problematic latent variables $\bm{\theta}$ and $\mathbf{z}$, and the last step follows from Jensen's inequality.

The EM algorithm consists in alternatively maximizing the lower bound $\mathcal{L}$ on the log likelihood with respect to the distribution $q$ (the E-step), and with respect to parameters $\bm{\alpha}$ and $\bm{\beta}$ (the M-step).

One can easily show that maximizing $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $q$ is equivalent to minimizing $KL(q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}) || p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}))$. A simple solution is thus to set $q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})$ to be $p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})$, the true posterior over latent variables under the model.

In our case, things are not so simple. The posterior takes the following form:
\begin{align}
p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}) &=
\frac{p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}, \mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})}
		{p(\mathbf{w} | \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})} \\
&= \frac{p(\bm{\theta} | \bm{\alpha}) \prod_{n=1}^N p(z_n | \bm{\theta})
	p(w_n | z_n, \bm{\beta})}
	{\int_{\bm{\theta}} p(\bm{\theta} | \bm{\alpha}) \prod_{n=1}^N 			\sum_{z_n=1}^K p(z_n | 	\bm{\theta}) p(w_n | z_n, \bm{\beta})}
\end{align}

Because of the integral over $\bm{\theta}$ and the sum over $z_n$ in the denominator, this expression is intractable. We must use approximate inference to estimate the posterior over latent variables $\bm{\theta}$ and $\mathbf{z}$. We will explore both variational inference and Gibbs sampling to solve this problem.

\subsection{Variational Inference}
Variational inference is one solution to approximate the intractable per-document posterior $p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})$. The basic idea is to introduce a parametrized family of distributions over latent variables and phrase inference as an optimization problem. 

We parametrize $q$ as follows, according to the mean field independence assumption:
\begin{equation}
q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \bm{\gamma}, \bm{\phi}) =
q(\bm{\theta} | \bm{\gamma}) \prod_{n=1}^N q(z_n | \bm{\phi}_n)
\end{equation}
where the dirichlet parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ and the multinomial parameters $\bm{\phi}_n$, $n \in \{1,...,N\}$ are free variational parameters. 

In section 1.1.2, we saw that maximizing the lower bound $\mathcal{L}$ on the likelihood with respect to the distribution $q$ was equivalent to minimizing $KL(q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z}) || p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}))$ with respect to $q$. We saw that since the posterior $p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})$ was intractable, we could not minimize this objective by simply setting $q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z})$ to be the posterior, and we thus had to find another strategy. 

Variational inference consists in minimizing the KL objective with respect to the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ and $\bm{\phi}$ of $q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \bm{\gamma}, \bm{\phi})$. Note that $q(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \bm{\gamma}, \bm{\phi})$ is actually a conditional distribution varying as a function of $\mathbf{w}$ because the optimization objective depends on $\mathbf{w}$. It can thus be seen as an approximation to the posterior $p(\bm{\theta}, \mathbf{z} | \mathbf{w}, \bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})$.

With this tool at our disposal, we can come back and complete the EM algorithm described in section 1.1.2. We can expand our variational lower bound on the per-document log likelihood as follows:
\begin{multline}
\mathcal{L}(\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\phi},\bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta}) = 
\mathbf{E}_q [log p(\bm{\theta} | \bm{\alpha})] + 
\mathbf{E}_q [log p(\mathbf{z} | \bm{\theta})] + \\
\mathbf{E}_q [log p(\mathbf{w} | \mathbf{z}, \bm{\beta})] -
\mathbf{E}_q [log q(\bm{\theta} | \bm{\gamma})] -
\mathbf{E}_q [log q(\mathbf{z} | \bm{\phi})]
\end{multline}
where the first three terms correspond to the expected complete log likelihood under $q$ and the last two terms to the entropy of $q$.

\subsubsection{E-step}
In the E-step, we maximize $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the variational parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ and $\bm{\phi}$. This corresponds to applying the following update rules iteratively until convergence for each document:
\begin{equation} 
\label{phi_update}
\bm{\phi}_{n,k} \propto \bm{\beta}_{k, w_n} exp\{\Psi(\bm{\gamma}_k)\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{gamma_update}
\bm{\gamma}_{k} = \bm{\alpha}_{k} + \sum_{n=1}^N \bm{\phi}_{n,k}
\end{equation}
where $\Psi(x) = \frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}$ is the digamma function.

Theses updates make sense intuitively. Equation \ref{phi_update} tells us that $\bm{\phi}_{n,k}$, the probability that word $w_n$ is generated by latent topic $k$, is proportional to the probability of drawing $w_n$ from topic $k$ times a quantity proportional to how much the document likes topic $k$ (the dirichlet parameter $\bm{\gamma}_k$). Equation \ref{gamma_update} tells us that the dirichlet parameter $\bm{\gamma}_k$ is equal to the pseudo-count $\bm{\alpha}_k$ given by the dirichlet prior plus the expected count of words picking topic $k$.

\subsubsection{M-step}
For the M-step, we maximize the overall variational lower bound with respect to parameter $\bm{\beta}$. We could also maximize with respect to $\bm{\alpha}$ but we chose to keep it fixed to make things simpler. As said before, the overall log likelihood of the corpus is the sum of the log likelihoods for the individual documents. Likewise, the overall variational lower bound is the sum of the individual variational bounds. 

Maximizing with respect to $\bm{\beta}$ gives the following update:
\begin{equation} 
\label{beta_update}
\bm{\beta}_{k,j} \propto \sum_{d=1}^D \sum_{n=1}^{N_d} \bm{\phi}_{d, n, k}
w_{d,n}^{(j)}
\end{equation}
where we abuse notation and index word $w_{d,n}$ which was a scalar until here as a one hot vector.

Equation \ref{beta_update} also has an intuitive meaning: the probability of word $j$ under topic $k$ is proportional to the expected count under the variational distribution of the number of times word $j$ is assigned topic $k$ across the whole corpus.

\subsubsection{Overall Algorithm}

We implemented a variational "EM flavored" algorithm which we described in detail in algorithm below. Note that to be strictly an EM algorithm, we should maximize $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $\bm{\phi}$ and $\bm{\gamma}$ all the way at each E-step. Instead, we alternate a single step of improvement with respect to the variational parameters with one step of improvement with respect to $\bm{\beta}$. Our algorithm has the same guarantee to increase the variational lower bound at each iteration, it is just more convenient to check for convergence only for the overall algorithm instead of for each E-step.
